Duration: 4 Weeks (15th July 2025 to 7th August 2025)

📖 About the Internship

This 4-week program focused on providing practical skills in AI and Cloud Computing. The internship was structured with weekly virtual sessions, mentor guidance, and hands-on labs. The curriculum included:

Week 1: Internship Orientation, IBM Cloud Registration, Artificial Intelligence.
Week 2: Data Analytics concepts, Hands-On Labs, and Cloud EDA.
Week 3 & 4: Building a Chat Bot, AI/ML experiments on the cloud, and a deep dive into AutoAI experiments on IBM Cloud.
Successful completion required active participation, completion of at least two courses on IBM SkillsBuild, and the submission of a final project presentation. This internship was offered with no stipend.

💡 Project: Inteview Trainer Agent
Problem Statement
An AI-powered Interview Trainer Agent uses Retrieval-Augmented 
Generation (RAG) to create personalized interview questions, answers, 
and preparation tips based on a user’s job role, experience, and profile. 
It combines technical and soft-skill assessments with curated 
resources, helping candidates build confidence, sharpen responses, 
and improve success rates in competitive interviews..


An AI‑powered interview preparation solution was developed to help candidates practice for job interviews effectively. The system uses Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG) to generate personalized interview questions, concise answers, preparation tips, and curated resource links based on the user’s role, experience level, and profile.

The final agent was deployed as a real‑time web application on the IBM Cloud platform, making it accessible to users for interactive interview practice.

⚙️ Technology Stack
Cloud Platform: IBM Cloud
AI/ML Service: IBM Watsonx.ai Studio
Model: IBM Granite (LLM for contextual Q&A)
Agent Development: IBM Agent Lab
Backend: Python (Flask)
Frontend: HTML, CSS
Containerization: Docker for IBM Code Engine
🚀 Project Workflow
User Data Intake: The agent collects role, experience, and profile details to personalize preparation.
Content Retrieval: Using RAG, the agent retrieves role‑specific interview content from trusted sources.
Question Generation: The Granite model generates technical, HR, and behavioral interview questions with concise answers.
Preparation Support: Adds 2–3 interview tips and curated resource links (e.g., InterviewBit, GeeksforGeeks).
Deployment: The fully trained agent was deployed as a web application via IBM Code Engine for global accessibility.
Testing: The application was validated through real‑time queries, ensuring relevance and accuracy of responses.

📊 Results
The deployed Interview Trainer Agent successfully generated relevant, role‑specific interview questions, concise answers, preparation tips, and curated resource links for multiple job roles and experience levels.
Personalization: Delivered customized content based on user inputs (role, experience).
Diversity: Generated technical, HR, and behavioral questions across different domains.
Real‑Time Performance: Provided instant responses through its IBM Cloud‑hosted web application.
Ease of Use: Designed with a clean web interface for an accessible, user‑friendly experience.<img width="891" height="874" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-01 105654" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/359fdbf0-1184-459d-b9b4-a48580969552" />
